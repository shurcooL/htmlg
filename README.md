Package htmlg contains helper funcs for generating HTML nodes and rendering them.
Context-aware escaping is done just like in html/template, making it safe against code injection.

Note: This package is quite experimental in nature, so its API is susceptible to more frequent
changes than the average package. This is necessary in order to keep this package useful.
